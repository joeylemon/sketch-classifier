# Sketch Classifier

A Tensorflow.js script to construct and train a convolutional neural network to classify sketches. This script is built to make use of Google's ["Quick, Draw!"](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) dataset. Google's dataset is provided in the form of drawing strokes instead of images. Therefore, during the training of the model, these strokes were used to generate images on-the-fly to be fed into the network. Additionally, to provide the network with even more context on stroke patterns, each individual stroke is colored differently, as seen below. White is the first stroke, red is the second, blue is the third, etc.

Each image is scaled to 64x64 pixels before being fed into the network. Below is the summary of the simple network model used in this script.

| Layer  | Output Shape | Num Params |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| conv2d_Conv2D1 (Conv2D)  | [null,60,60,4]  | 304  |
| max_pooling2d_MaxPooling2D1  | [null,30,30,4]  | 0  |
| conv2d_Conv2D2 (Conv2D)   | [null,26,26,8]   | 808  |
| max_pooling2d_MaxPooling2D2  | [null,13,13,8]  | 0  |
| flatten_Flatten1 (Flatten)  | [null,1352]  | 0  |
| dense_Dense1 (Dense)  | [null,19]  | 25707  |

## Usage

First, download the sketches you wish to use to train the model to a directory named `sketches/`. The data is in the form of `.ndjson` files and can be downloaded from [Google Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/simplified;tab=objects?prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false).

Then, you must prepare the data into training and testing files. This can be done with the prepare.js script:
```sh
> node prepare.js
```

This will create `test_data.ndjson` and `train_data.ndjson` containing shuffled and split records from every dataset in `sketches/`. Now, you may run the training script with:
```sh
> node train.js
```

Tensorflow will output the training progress throughout the execution of the script. When the model has reached a satisfactory accuracy, you may predict a single random image from the `sketches/` directory using the following command:
```sh
> node predict.js
```

This script will output the probability of each label and also save the random drawing to `image.png` so you may view it.
